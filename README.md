### Getting started

The code is written and tested with Matlab 2017a. Modifications might be necessary to run it with other versions of Matlab.

You need a GPU to extract features from pre-trained VGG19.

### Installing 

```
git clone https://github.com/vohuy93/rOSD.git
```

```
cd rOSD; mkdir data
```

## Running the tests

Download [VGG19 model](https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat) and put it in [data/.matconvnet/models](data/.matconvnet/models).

The main scripts for testing the code on VOC_6x2 are [run_proposals.m](run_proposals.m), [run_scores.m](run_scores.m) and [run_rOSD.m](run_rOSD.m). In matlab, from the rOSD folder, run 

```
set_path; run_proposals; run_scores; run_rOSD;
```

For a quick test, you can use the precomputed scores instead. In matlab, from the rOSD folder, run

```
set_path; run_proposals;
```   

Download [the scores](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q9mCnD9MIO0-CA6LvYvPR8JWSllDJSFX?usp=sharing) and put them in [data/vocx_cnn](data/vocx_cnn) by class, then from the rOSD folder, run

```
set_path; run_rOSD;
```
